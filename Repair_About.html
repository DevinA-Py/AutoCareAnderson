         <h2>Our Story</h2>
         <p>
            Anderson Auto Care started as a small two-bay garage with a simple goal:
            treat every customer’s car as if it were our own. Over the years we’ve grown,
            but that mindset hasn’t changed. We believe in clear communication, honest
            recommendations, and repairs that you can rely on.
         </p>
         <p>
            Whether you drive an older commuter car, a family SUV, or a work truck, our team
            is here to help you stay safe on the road without breaking your budget.

         <p>
            Our shop is equipped with modern diagnostic tools and equipment, but we still
            rely on experience and common sense. From check engine lights to strange
            noises, we take time to properly diagnose the problem before recommending any work.
